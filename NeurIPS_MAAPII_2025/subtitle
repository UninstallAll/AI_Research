The world is not static, but is continuously calculated, simulated, and reshaped.

In the flow of code and data, artists create surreal illusions, engineers construct precise structures, scientists extrapolate the laws of nature, game developers breathe life into virtual worlds, and filmmakers manipulate light and shadow to reconstruct the order of reality. Each simulation is a rewriting of the world, each calculation defines possibility.

However, simulation is not only about creation but also about selection and omission.

Storage and forgetting have never been neutral acts. 

The earliest writing media recorded civilizations but also omitted countless unrecorded voices. 

Archives preserve history while erasing narratives that were never archived. 

Today, databases and algorithms filter information, deciding which data to store and which to ignore. Media archaeologist Wolfgang Ernst points out that the temporality of technology not only shapes memory but also silently edits the past.

In such a world, how do we discern reality? When simulation becomes the norm, which memories still exist, and which have vanished?

Now, a new world has been unfolded.

Whether you are a creator, a calculator, or an observer, the flow of data is guiding you forward.

Cross boundaries, step into the realm of simulation, and search for stories that have not yet been forgotten in the space between digital and reality.

The history of humanity's control over reality through models is essentially a process of cognition becoming increasingly technologized.

In pre-industrial times, clay sandboxes and armillary spheres served as the first systematic models, monopolized by the ruling classes as tools for explaining reality—whether Mesopotamian war simulations or Mayan astronomical instruments, all defined "what is reality."

The Scientific Revolution overturned this paradigm: Galileo's inclined plane experiments and Newton's prism transformed models into verifiable probes of truth. Yet laboratory ship hull models also fragmented cognition—humans began deconstructing the world through piecemeal models.

In the 20th century consumer wave, Tamiya models and Bandai Gundam figurines transformed models into symbols of mass culture. When Neon Genesis Evangelion Unit-01 models carried the memories of millions of youth, the value of models had shifted from function to emotional identification.

The 21st century digital revolution completely rewrote the rules: deep learning and GAN networks taught models to create. DALL·E generating "Baroque quantum computers" announced that humans were no longer the sole creators—models constructed parallel universes through latent space.

In today's algorithmic society, ESM-2 protein models with billions of parameters demonstrate emergent capabilities beyond their programming, while urban traffic and virus transmission models reversely discipline human decision-making. As GPT-4 autonomously optimizes code, tools are evolving into cognitive entities.

This cognitive migration from clay to code ultimately forces humans to answer: when models become the arbiters of truth, how do we reanchor our own existence?

Game simulation brings a completely new narrative experience.

In the third-person perspective, every player action is mapped onto the character's movements, with the story unfolding according to player choices, as if everything is shaped by them. 

In this virtual world, games construct an illusion of "completion," where past narrative intertwines with present actions, forming a cyclical experience. 

Through constant repetition, players become accustomed to the information conveyed by the plot, and the game's persuasiveness subtly takes effect. 

But sometimes, a voice whispers: "This is all just code." 

Players begin to question whether their experiences in the game are truly their own experiences. 

Can a character's memories become their treasures? 

And when cracks appear in the virtual world, exposing the underlying code, everything seems stripped of its magical veil, and the game begins to explicitly reveal its own structure.

However, games are not just games. 

When players take a step back and observe their own behavior within the game, the game of games—the metagame—emerges. 

Real-world rules infiltrate the game: money, equipment, competitive strategies—real-world investments influence virtual experiences. 

The significance of metagaming lies not only in breaking traditional rules but in allowing players to drift between game and reality, being both experiencers and observers. 

Ultimately, the hyperreality of games is no longer confined to the screen; it invades reality, changing how players perceive the world and creating a new reality.

When games return from simulation to reality and reexamine simulation itself, a simulation about simulation, a game about games—the metagame—emerges. 

As players step back further from the screen, the third-person object becomes the player themselves. 

Reflection, psychological gamesmanship, rule-breaking, the use of money and equipment—real-world investments significantly influence the game. 

This is common in most competitive or RPG games, where players employ real-world rules for the purpose of playing games. 

From a media perspective, metagaming points toward the reality about games, extracting players from traditional gameplay rules. 

During the gaming process, they no longer merely play roles but simultaneously experience both their own reality and the hyperreality within the game. 

The simulation of metagaming depends not only on player interaction but also continuously influences players' perception of their own reality. 

The hyperreality of simulation invades reality through the player, creating a new reality.

Metagaming, realized through computers, establishes a "third space" between reality and virtuality. Algorithms are not merely tools but extensions of cognition and culture, reshaping how we understand the world.

Algorithms both mimic reality and create possibilities. This closely resembles human thinking: we rely on the known to understand the world, yet break boundaries through imagination. Algorithmic simulation is a digital mapping of our cognitive processes.

This mapping prompts us to reconsider the essence of life. From von Neumann to Langton's experiments, it's suggested that life may not be exclusively carbon-based existence, but rather an information pattern—a complex process of self-evolution.

From a media perspective, algorithms are carriers of power. Interaction design and rules in games and applications invisibly transmit ideology, constituting a special form of "procedural rhetoric."

Procedural rhetoric changes behavior through rules and influences thinking through mechanisms. It not only shapes individual habits but also reconstructs social culture—this is the core influence of algorithmic simulation in the digital age.

Our world is filled with symbols that don't merely express reality but silently reconstruct it. Bourdieu called this the accumulation of "symbolic capital"—this simulation filters and reorganizes, eliminating redundancy while reinforcing specific symbols.

Think about those "Perfect life" photos on social media, each carefully curated, a symbolic reproduction of reality. Those luxury displays and travel check-ins aren't just records of memories but reconstructions of power relationships.

As McLuhan told us: "The medium is the message." Whether Instagram filters or Facebook's like system, these virtual communities reshape how we perceive the world through their design and rules, gradually replacing the authenticity of information with the persuasiveness of symbols.

Games have pushed this simulation to new heights. They're no longer just entertainment but complex information conveyed through programmed rules. Consider how "McDonald's Video Game" reveals the problems behind the fast-food industry through seemingly simple interactions.

How art games like "Passage" and "Journey" break through traditional narratives, guiding us to explore profound themes of life, memory, and solitude. These are programmatic expressions of creators' thoughts, a new form of art.

When news becomes interactive experiences, information acquisition becomes personal participation. "Escape from Woomera" doesn't just let you read about refugee plights but experience them; "Budget Hero" doesn't explain fiscal policy but helps you understand its complexity through choices. This is a revolution in information transmission.

This transformation didn't happen suddenly. Benjamin pointed out in "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" how technological innovation changed the essence of art. The invention of photography and film caused art to lose its unique "aura," but also opened up entirely new forms of expression.

Today, we've entered what Baudrillard called the age of "simulacra"—simulation no longer merely copies reality but transcends it, becoming an independent symbol system. When we immerse ourselves in virtual worlds, we're experiencing not a mirror of reality, but a new form of reality.

Roland Barthes' "Mythologies" further reminds us that all images and symbols are products of cultural coding. When viewing simulations, we're not interpreting the objective world but a network of meanings constructed by culture.



This power of simulation is particularly evident in politics. "The Howard Dean for Iowa Game" is not just entertainment but an interactive model of the political system, allowing us to personally experience the subtle interactions between electoral strategies and public opinion.

When "September 12th" places us in the scene of counter-terrorism warfare, facing the consequences of civilian casualties, games transcend simple entertainment to become powerful expressions of anti-war political positions.

Similarly, in "PeaceMaker," we stand at diplomatic negotiation tables, facing difficult choices in the Middle East peace process. Through this experience, complex international relations are no longer abstract concepts but perceptible realities.



In education, this transformation is equally profound. "SimEarth" transforms abstract ecological concepts into interactive systems, making environmental science not just exist in textbooks but become objects that learners can directly perceive and manipulate.

The "Civilization" series has completely changed how we understand history—history is no longer a static chronology but a dynamic process of decisions and consequences. Players experience countless complex factors behind the rise and fall of civilizations through personal participation.

Even games like "The Oregon Trail" transform the historical experience of 19th century American western pioneering into an experiential journey. History education changes from memorizing terms and events to personally experiencing past ways of life. This is a fundamental transformation in learning methods.




This power of simulation extends to deeper cognitive and philosophical levels. Games as rhetorical media convey profound viewpoints through their rules and mechanisms. "Civilization" explores the evolution of power, "September 12th" reflects on cycles of violence, and "SimCity" reveals the politics behind resource allocation.

Edward Lorenz's chaos theory shows us that even the simplest systems can produce unpredictable complex behaviors—a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil might cause a tornado in Texas. This concept has been widely applied in today's open-world games, artificial intelligence algorithms, and market simulations.

As Lev Manovich pointed out in his study of new media language, simulation is not just a product of technology but a mapping of our culture and cognition. By creating these simulated worlds, we're not just reproducing reality but creating new cognitive frameworks and philosophical possibilities.




From social media photos on street corners to complex political simulation games; from new forms of artistic representation to revolutions in education and learning—simulation has penetrated every aspect of our lives. It not only reconstructs the reality before us but creates new ways of understanding this reality. In this increasingly complex digital age, simulation has become an important bridge connecting technology and humanities, helping us understand and shape this constantly changing world.

At the intersection of contemporary art and games, the boundaries of perspective are broken. 

We can be "Flow," transforming into mayflies, immersed in the current, feeling the lightness and freedom of life. In such simulations, I am no longer the human self; I become "Everything"—a desert mouse on the grasslands, rolling nimbly, fur collecting soil, bending the grass; or a cloud in the sky, observing the changes of the earth. 

Through these fusions of art and games, we transcend the boundaries of species, re-examine the position of humans, and feel the pulse and resonance of the organic and inorganic.

Everything can serve as a medium. Artists, through various techniques, attempt to simulate certain profound ideas or emotions within specific media. 

However, what they simulate is always limited by the framework of the medium. For example, can infinity be simulated? Although artists intend to pursue an "infinite" experience through these media, true infinity exists in the imagination between the audience and the work. 

The audience's understanding and interpretation become key to this process; artists cannot fully control the audience's perception. Therefore, the meaning of artwork often lies in how the audience interacts with it. 

On the other hand, developing AI is gradually becoming the subject of creation. 

Looking at art from a non-human perspective, separating the artist's concept from expectations of the audience, focusing on the medium and the work itself—there is no work beyond the medium, only simulation within the medium.

So what is simulation beyond the medium? Before exploring this question, we need to first focus on the relationship between the artist and the medium.

The process of debugging artificial intelligence to ensure it develops in accordance with human needs is referred to as artificial intelligence alignment. 

When AI is capable of generating images and videos using various mediums, the generative logic of AI should be aligned with its medium, a concept we can call "medium alignment." 

Historically, only humans have invented and utilized medium, so we continue to view art through the lens of future medium archaeology. Artists who create using medium should also adopt a critical method of "medium alignment."

If practice comes first, is the artist's understanding sufficient to match the creative outcomes? Conversely, if concept comes first, has the artist selected the appropriate medium for expression?

From the perspective of medium alignment, some artworks effectively utilize their medium, allowing it to convey their ideas. 

However, other artworks cater to the market, where their interpretation creates excessive value that is not inherent to the medium, leading to a situation where the medium cannot support its inflated concept. In such cases, the medium is diminished, not because the artist is overly avant-garde and has deconstructed the medium through their concept, but because the medium's intrinsic value pales in comparison to its fictional commercial value. 

These works are often sold in specific forms, with concepts becoming commodities and the medium merely serving as a price tag. In contrast, through the work of Yves Klein, we can observe that when an artist genuinely deconstructs the medium through their concept and transcends it, the medium of the work becomes difficult to determine.

The current state of AI is characterized by its ambiguity. As a medium, AI has the capability to integrate various forms of medium, and perhaps in the future, it will also be able to deconstruct both medium and itself. Art is facing a crisis of subjectivity; the rise of AI raises concerns about its potential to replace humans in the creative process. In this regard, Dreyfus questions AI's lack of a physical body, which limits its ability to think intuitively. Lacking sensory perception, AI cannot substitute for human experience, even as a symbolic entity. Simondon's theory of individuation posits that technology and humans co-evolve; thus, AI will not replace humans but can assist in the advancement of human civilization. The human body is not a deficiency; rather, it is the sensations and intuitive thinking that make humans unique subjects. The non-human perspective does not abandon humanity but acknowledges a pluralistic reality, prompting reflection on the human position.

We once claimed that art is dead and philosophy is dead. However, as long as human civilization exists, both philosophy and art continue to thrive. We define the end of an era to redirect our thinking. Today, as technology gives rise to new medium, and as medium continuously transcends itself, we need new understandings to engage with these new forms. For artists, the goal is not to use new medium to express old ideas, but to create new expressions that resonate within these new mediums, simulating innovative concepts.

Not only is AI becoming a new medium, but throughout history, artists have also created new medium, even if these were not widely recognized. We often view these creations as unique expressions of individual artists, overlooking the broader definition of what constitutes a new medium. This oversight largely stems from the fact that such new medium are not merely technological innovations; they may also deviate from Western-centric technological frameworks, leading to their exclusion from the category of medium technologies.

Stiegler defines technology as the "third memory," an externalization of human collective memory. He describes technology as a "pharmakon"—both a remedy and a poison—simultaneously enhancing our capabilities while potentially leading to their atrophy. He warns that the digital economy transforms human attention into quantifiable resources through algorithms. Yuk Hui's concept of "Cosmic Technicism" disrupts the linear narrative of technological development, suggesting that diverse cultures give rise to diverse technologies. His caution regarding "algorithmic catastrophe" highlights contemporary technology's struggle to manage ontological contingency. He argues that artists should transform science by first turning scientific necessity into contingency and then making that contingency necessary again.

Whenever artists encounter new technology, they tend to create rough conceptual models from which new medium may emerge. Although these models often lack practicality, they serve as simulations of concepts and contain the potential for the evolution from "simulation" to "becoming." As the philosophy of technology suggests, the real issue is not technology itself, but rather our relationship with it—a relationship that can be continuously reshaped through reflection and practice. In the process of artists transforming technology into a medium, they explore how human sensation and creativity can coexist with it, raising questions about we humanity, the kinds of beings we aspire to be, and the world we hope to create.
