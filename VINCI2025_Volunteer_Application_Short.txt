Subject: Volunteer Application for VINCI 2025

Dear VINCI 2025 Organizing Committee,

I am Shuai Liu from Academy of Media Arts Cologne (KHM), writing to apply for a volunteer position at VINCI 2025. Mar Canet Sola recommended this opportunity to me.

I have two accepted papers at the conference:
- #138 - "Prosomoíosi" (Simulation)
- #152 - "From Code to Camera: The Making and Meaning of Prosomoíosi (Simulation), an AI Documentary Film"

My background in AI-driven media arts and multilingual abilities (English/Chinese/German/French) would enable me to effectively support conference activities and assist international attendees.

I am fully committed to contributing to VINCI 2025's success and would be honored to serve as a volunteer.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Shuai Liu
