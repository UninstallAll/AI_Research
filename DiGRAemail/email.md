Subject: Application for DiGRA AI Subcommittee Participation

Dear Dr. Adam Jerrett and DiGRA Executive Committee,

I am writing to express my strong interest in participating in the DiGRA AI Subcommittee. As a digital media artist and researcher with extensive experience in AI-driven creative practices and game studies, I believe I can contribute valuable perspectives to this important initiative.

**Personal Profile (200 words):**

I am Liu Shuai (刘帅), a Chinese digital media artist and researcher currently pursuing an MFA at the Academy of Media Arts Cologne (KHM), with a BFA in Digital Media Art from Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts. Since 2024, I serve as a research fellow at the Digital Humanities Research Center of Renmin University of China and as an advisor to Jinan University's Centre for AI and New Media Art.

My practice centers on the intersection of artificial intelligence, interactive media, and critical game studies. I have developed the concept of "medium alignment" in AI art, arguing for transparent algorithmic processes that become visible narrative layers rather than hidden infrastructure. My recent works, including "Prosomoíosi (Simulation)" and "Phantastikè," employ real-time AI generation systems (TouchDesigner, StreamDiffusion, ComfyUI) to explore how successive simulation technologies overwrite cultural memory.

In 2024, I co-founded LUDUS Magazine (https://ludusofficial.site/), an experimental game publication collaborating with Academy of Media Arts Cologne and University of Applied Arts Vienna, fostering interdisciplinary exchange on AI art and game studies. My works have received international recognition, including the Goethe-Institut "AIsolation" AI Short-Film Award and selections at various international festivals.

**Potential Contributions:**

I can offer unique perspectives from several angles:

1. **Cross-Cultural AI Ethics**: As a Chinese artist working in European academic contexts, I can contribute insights on how AI regulations and ethical frameworks translate across different cultural and legal systems, particularly between East Asian and Western approaches to AI governance.

2. **Creative AI Pedagogy**: Through my teaching and workshop experience, I can share practical approaches for integrating AI tools in creative education while maintaining artistic integrity and critical thinking.

3. **Multilingual Academic Support**: My experience publishing in both Chinese and English academic contexts provides insights into how AI can support multilingual scholarship without compromising cultural specificity and authorial voice.

4. **Game Studies and AI**: Through LUDUS Magazine and my research, I can contribute perspectives on how AI is transforming game design, narrative, and player agency, addressing questions of procedural rhetoric and algorithmic storytelling.

5. **Environmental and Technical Considerations**: My hands-on experience with various AI systems (from local deployments to cloud services) provides practical knowledge about the environmental costs and technical accessibility issues surrounding AI adoption in academia.

6. **Artistic Research Methodologies**: I can contribute insights on how AI can be used as both a research tool and object of study in practice-based research, particularly in media arts and digital humanities.

I am particularly interested in addressing the subcommittee's guiding questions around responsible AI use cases, the balance between technological innovation and environmental responsibility, and the development of frameworks that acknowledge both the potential and limitations of AI in academic contexts.
