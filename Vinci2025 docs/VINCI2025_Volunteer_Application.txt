Subject: Volunteer Application for VINCI 2025 - Recommended by Mar Canet Sola

Dear VINCI 2025 Organizing Committee,

I am writing to apply for a volunteer position at the VINCI 2025 International Symposium on Visual Information Communication and Interaction. I am Shuai Liu, currently studying at the Academy of Media Arts Cologne (KHM), specializing in media arts and AI applications.

I am pleased to inform you that I have two accepted papers at VINCI 2025:
- #138 - "Prosomoíosi" (Simulation)
- #152 - "From Code to Camera: The Making and Meaning of Prosomoíosi (Simulation), an AI Documentary Film"

Mar Canet Sola recommended me for this volunteer opportunity, recognizing my background in generative AI, real-time diffusion models, and AI documentary production. Our collaborative research explores "medium alignment" concepts and how AI technologies reshape cultural memory and identity.

As a volunteer, I can contribute:
- Technical expertise in TouchDesigner, ComfyUI, and AI generation tools
- Multilingual communication (English, Chinese, basic German)
- Experience in academic event organization and multimedia presentations
- Deep understanding of the conference themes in visual information and interaction

I am fully committed to supporting the conference activities and would be honored to contribute to VINCI 2025's success while expanding my knowledge in visual information communication.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,

Shuai Liu
