# Artism: Extended Literature Review and Project Framework

## Introduction

Contemporary art is trapped in an unprecedented conceptual crisis. As philosopher Peter Osborne points out in *Crisis as Form*, contemporary art faces a state of permanent crisis that no longer "records decisive moments in processes of transformation" but destroys the subjective core of the crisis concept¹. In this state, most artists choose to engage in superficial cyclical operations within the existing contemporary art system, seeking differentiated expression through mechanical rearrangement and recombination of existing cultural symbols and art forms, but this effort paradoxically leads to deep conceptual homogenization².

The theoretical roots of this dilemma can be traced back to Walter Benjamin's insights into the fate of artworks in the age of mechanical reproduction. Benjamin proposed that mechanical reproduction devalued the "aura" (uniqueness) of artworks, essentially transforming art production into political practice³. In the contemporary context of widespread artificial intelligence technology, this reproductive characteristic becomes even more pronounced: generative AI not only redefines the traditional aura of art but also completely blurs the boundary between original and reproduction in AI-generated works⁴. Anyone can easily generate seemingly original artistic content, thus completely dissolving the uniqueness and authority of artistic creation in the traditional sense⁵.

Facing this fundamental change, contemporary art urgently needs new research methodologies and media paradigms. It is against this background that the "Artism" project emerges, aiming to deeply explore the operational mechanisms of contemporary art's conceptual dilemmas through an AI-driven dual-system architecture. The project constructs a parallel virtual art history world, positioning artificial intelligence as a critical interpretive partner of human creativity. The system simulates art history through multi-agent interactions via AIDA (Artificial Intelligence Artist Database), while employing IsmismMachine for computational critical analysis of contemporary art practices, exploring how to open new conceptual spaces and practical paths for artistic creation while acknowledging technological logic.

## Literature Review

### Contemporary Art's Conceptual Crisis and Creative Homogenization

Contemporary art faces an unprecedented conceptual crisis. The essence of this crisis lies in the fact that "crisis," which traditionally signified the possibility of transformation, has become a norm, and the art field can no longer achieve genuine transformation through crisis¹. At the creative practice level, this crisis manifests specifically in the over-exploitation of theoretical resources, mechanical recombination of cultural symbols, and the increasing separation between innovative discourse and actual content.

Reviewing the developmental trajectory of conceptual art reveals that although the conceptual art movement initially attempted to completely change the institutional framework of art and challenge traditional art production and circulation systems², this radical critical stance was ultimately absorbed and disciplined by existing cultural institutions. A significant phenomenon in contemporary art practice is that artists often seek expressive differentiation within relatively fixed theoretical frameworks, but this effort instead leads to homogenization trends at the conceptual level. This phenomenon profoundly reflects the structural contradiction between criticality and systematization in contemporary art³.

From a deeper creative mechanism perspective, contemporary artists demonstrate a noteworthy **algorithmic characteristic** in their process of extracting and recombining cultural resources: they use established cultural symbols and theoretical frameworks as input, recombine them through individualized processing rules, and ultimately output works that appear differentiated on the surface but are essentially highly similar. This creative mode constitutes the core manifestation of what this research focuses on as the **conceptual collage syndrome**, and is also the key issue that the "Artism" project attempts to explore and critique.

### Critical Theory and AI Art Systems

Critical theory provides multiple important theoretical perspectives for analyzing AI art phenomena. Adorno's aesthetic theory demonstrates unique explanatory power in AI art analysis: through the perspective of negative dialectics, we can see that AI art embodies a complex dialectical relationship—attempting to maintain some aesthetic autonomy while inevitably being disciplined by technological logic. Adorno's discourse on art's "semi-autonomy" provides important tools for understanding this contradictory state⁴.

From another angle, Zylinska's research focuses on the fundamental changes in cognitive modes brought by generative AI, revealing the increasingly superficial and fragmented application of theory in contemporary art practice⁵. This observation provides important insights for understanding contemporary art's conceptual crisis.

Benjamin's classical discourse on mechanical reproduction has also gained new attention in AI art research. Contemporary scholars re-examine the fate of artworks' "aura": in an era when AI can infinitely generate visual content, some studies find that technology creates a complex situation where liberation and dependence coexist⁶, while others propose the concept of "semi-aura" to describe the ambiguous state of AI-generated works in terms of originality⁷.

### Post-Digital Theory and Technological Philosophical Foundations

Post-digital theory provides an important conceptual framework for understanding the technological condition of contemporary art. Cramer's proposed "post-digital" concept does not point to the end of technology, but describes a new cultural state: digital technology no longer exists as novelty but becomes the infrastructure of daily life¹¹. The core characteristic of this state is that artists no longer pursue technological innovation but reconfigure digitization as an established fact. An important dimension of post-digital aesthetics is attention to technological failure—system crashes, errors, glitches and other phenomena are incorporated into artistic creation¹², providing new perspectives for understanding contemporary art's conceptual crisis.

At the technological philosophical level, Heidegger's thought provides deep foundations for analyzing the relationship between art and technology in the AI era. Research by Thomson, Adeshola and others applies Heidegger's philosophy of technology to AI contexts, exploring the manifestation of technological "unconcealment" (aletheia) processes in AI art¹³¹⁴. This analytical path reveals that AI art is not merely the application of technological tools, but the manifestation of technology in an ontological sense.

The combination of post-digital theory and philosophy of technology provides theoretical foundations for understanding the "Artism" project: they jointly point to an era of post-technological novelty, where art's task is no longer to demonstrate technological possibilities, but to critically reflect on the cultural reality that technology has already shaped.

### Computational Art History and Digital Humanities

The field of computational art history is experiencing a fundamental transformation from simple digitization to genuine computational analysis. Researchers are no longer satisfied with simply digitizing art historical materials, but are beginning to explore how to use computational methods to re-understand the internal logic of art history. Research by Lang and Ommer has landmark significance in this transformation: they demonstrate the possibility of multi-agent collaborative methods in art historical analysis, particularly the potential of Generative Adversarial Networks to create "hypothetical" art scenes⁸.

Manovich's methodological contributions in the field of cultural analysis provide important foundations for this turn. His cultural analytics framework not only provides technical tools but also reveals the deep mechanisms of cultural production in the digital age⁹. This large-scale data analysis approach opens new possibilities for understanding aesthetic problems in the AI era.

However, interdisciplinary research also faces challenges in knowledge structures. Mercuriali points out that computer scientists often lack the critical thinking of humanities disciplines, while humanities scholars lack necessary technical knowledge¹⁰. This knowledge gap precisely provides theoretical space for multi-agent methods: by simulating collaboration between agents with different knowledge backgrounds, it may be possible to explore new paths for bridging disciplinary divisions.

### Multi-Agent Systems Applications in Creative Fields

Multi-agent systems applications in creative fields open new methodological paths for art historical research. Researchers begin to understand artistic movements as emergent phenomena produced by interactions between individual artist agents, providing theoretical foundations for exploring "hypothetical" art historical scenarios through computational methods¹⁵. The core insight of this methodology is that art historical development is not a linear process, but the result of complex interactions between multiple factors, so it is possible to explore other historical possibilities by simulating different initial conditions and interaction rules.

Contemporary research further reveals fundamental changes in the concept of authorship in AI-era artistic creation. The transformation from individual creation to collaborative, distributed creative processes not only changes the production methods of artworks but also profoundly challenges traditional art historical narrative frameworks¹⁶. The significance of this transformation lies in its requirement to rethink the subjectivity of artistic creation—when the creative process involves collaboration between multiple agents (whether human artists, AI systems, or audiences), traditional "genius artist" narratives prove insufficient to explain complex creative realities.

The theoretical development of multi-agent creative systems is also reflected in the redefinition of creativity itself. Research shows that creativity is no longer viewed as an individual's inherent attribute, but as a collective phenomenon emerging from systematic interactive processes¹⁷. This understanding provides important inspiration for the AIDA system in this research: by simulating complex interactions between historical artists, contemporary artists, virtual prototype artists, and human participants, it is possible to explore emergence patterns of artistic innovation under different configurations, thereby providing new perspectives for understanding and critiquing contemporary art's conceptual crisis.

## Project Content

### 3.1 AIDA: Multi-Agent Art History Simulation

AIDA constructs dynamic art history simulation through four types of intelligent agents, aiming to explore multiple possibilities of art historical evolution. **Historical Artist NPCs** are digitally reconstructed based on archival materials, personal writings, and stylistic analysis, with each agent retaining personality traits derived from historical documents while being able to generate new works consistent with their established aesthetic frameworks. **Contemporary Artist NPCs** are machine learning models trained on the creative outputs and theoretical positions of active artists, providing dynamic representations of current art practices. **Virtual Prototype Artists** serve as AI-generated artistic entities with novel aesthetic approaches, functioning as experimental variables in art historical evolution scenarios. **Human Participants** as real users directly influence the evolutionary trajectory of the simulated art world through their interactions with the system.

The system operates based on multi-agent social simulation principles, with virtual artists participating in creative competitions, theoretical debates, and the formation of aesthetic movements. Real-world events input through user interactions serve as environmental parameters, continuously influencing the simulation's evolutionary process. AIDA's uniqueness lies in its "madness effect"—a practice embodying speculative realism. As Graham Harman's Object-Oriented Ontology proposes, all objects (whether real, fictional, natural, artificial, human, or non-human) are mutually autonomous, and objects cannot be exhausted by their relationships with humans or other objects. From this theoretical perspective, enabling Picasso to dialogue with ancient Chinese painters, allowing Van Gogh to live into the digital age—these "impossible" encounters represent the true power of art: breaking established relationship networks and creating new possibilities of reality.

### 3.2 IsmismMachine: Computational Critical Analysis System

IsmismMachine provides computational critical analysis of contemporary art practices, diagnosing conceptual crises in artworks through systematic statistics and concept label generation. The system not only identifies and marks "conceptual collage" phenomena in works but more importantly reveals the underlying algorithmic production logic. By analyzing the conceptual level of artworks, the system calculates their "conceptual entropy" indicators and generates corresponding critical labels, thus providing systematic diagnosis of the widespread theoretical appropriation and superficial innovation in contemporary art.

The system's theoretical foundation is built on a profound understanding of AI aesthetics development. As Lev Manovich points out in his AI aesthetics research, with the development of generative AI technology, our understanding of aesthetics, creativity, design, and art appreciation is undergoing fundamental transformation. Artificial intelligence is now being used to generate new synthetic cultural artifacts. When machines paint Rembrandt, compose Bach sonatas, or complete Beethoven symphonies, we face ancient questions about the nature of creativity. IsmismMachine, in the context of this technological evolution, attempts to analyze and critique the mechanisms of contemporary art production through computational methods.

As technology develops, our aesthetic concepts are also undergoing corresponding changes. AI now plays an equally important role in our cultural life, increasingly automating the aesthetic field. The output results of IsmismMachine are not only a diagnosis of contemporary art problems but also a critical reflection on this trend of aesthetic automation. The system-generated analysis reports show that many "innovations" in contemporary art actually follow predictable algorithmic patterns, thus revealing the complex relationship between human subjectivity and technological logic in the creative process.

### 3.3 System Integration and Critical Practice: Addressing the Art Crisis in "Burnout Society"

The core of the "Artism" project lies in the dynamic interaction between the AIDA and IsmismMachine systems. From the perspective of contemporary social theory, this dual-system architecture addresses precisely the specific manifestation of the contemporary predicament described by Byung-Chul Han in the art field. Contemporary society has transformed from a disciplinary society to an "achievement society," characterized by excessive positivity rather than prohibitive negativity¹. In the art field, this achievement compulsion manifests as a kind of innovation obsession—every artist desperately seeks the "next breakthrough," but this anxiety actually limits the genuine experimental spirit.

Virtual art historical events generated by AIDA provide analytical objects for IsmismMachine, while IsmismMachine's critical diagnoses in turn influence the evolutionary parameters of the AIDA system, forming a self-reflective critical loop. This dual-system architecture attempts to break the "self-exploitation" mode in traditional art production: artists are both exploiters and exploited, trapped in endless self-optimization and achievement pursuit². By introducing AI as a critical partner, the project attempts to create a new creative relationship.

The deeper significance of this project lies in providing contemporary art with a possibility for "slow thinking." True development, progress, and innovation require slow contemplation, reflection, and deep analysis, all of which cannot be achieved in overly active and stimulating environments³. The "Artism" project, through its dual-system reflective loop, attempts to restore this contemplative capacity abandoned by contemporary achievement society, thereby opening new conceptual spaces for art practice.

## Conclusion

Our reflection on contemporary art's crisis is rooted in a profound understanding of the complex relationship between technology and art. Traditional art concepts often simplify technology as neutral tools, yet technology has its own internal dynamics and evolutionary logic. As Stiegler points out, the deep essence of technology has long been suppressed by philosophy, while Simondon emphasizes that technical objects possess their own "genetic logic" and can even "invent" themselves. This insight into technology transcending the mere tool category inspires us to re-examine the current conceptual crisis in artistic creation.

The "Artism" project chooses to use technology and algorithms as the cornerstone of construction and analysis, not to "solve" technical problems, but to explore art's internal logic through artificial intelligence's potential as an analytical and operational "lens." In this "post-digital" era, the disruptive impact of digital technology has already occurred, and the "unique cult value" of artworks is being replaced by "manipulation value." Those "gray media"—databases and algorithms—profoundly influence cultural production behind the scenes.

Through the dynamic interaction between the AIDA system and IsmismMachine, the project attempts to reveal the operational mechanisms of these "gray media" and reflect on the increasingly intensified homogenization and conceptual crisis in artistic creation. Our goal is not only to explore the "gameplay" and "role" of technology in artistic creation, but more importantly, to rethink what artistic "originality" really is, thereby transcending the limitations of existing conceptual crises and exploring new possibilities for art and culture.

The significance of this exploration lies in providing us with an opportunity for reflection: in the current moment when technological logic is irreversible, how to preserve truly critical spaces for art, how to reactivate art's experimental spirit and contemplative capacity while acknowledging technological reality. We hope such reflection can provoke deeper discussions about the complex relationships between artistic essence, technological function, and human creativity.
